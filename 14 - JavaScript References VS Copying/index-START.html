      // let age = 100;
      // let age2 = age;
      // console.log(age, age2);
      // age = 200;
      // console.log(age, age2);

      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"];

      // and we want to make a copy of it.
      const team = players;

      console.log(players, team);

      // You might think we can just do something like this:
      team[3] = "Dude";

      console.log(players, team);

      // however what happens when we update that array?

      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

      // one way
      // const team2 = players.slice();

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      // const team2 = [].concat(players)
      // const team2 = Array.from(players);

      // or use the new ES6 Spread
      const team2 = [...players];
      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
      team2[2] = "dudette";
      console.log(players, team2);

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80
      };

      // and think we make a copy:
      const captain = person;
      captain.age = 30;

      console.log("person", person);
      console.log("captain", captain);

      // how do we take a copy instead?
      const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, { age: 100 });
      // captain2.age = 100;

      console.log("person", person);
      console.log("captain2", captain2);

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
      const captain3 = { ...person };
      captain3.name = "Dude";
      console.log("person", person);
      console.log("captain3", captain3);
      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
